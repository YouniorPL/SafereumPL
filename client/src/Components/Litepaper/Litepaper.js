            <br/>
              Simply put, it is a payment gateway that allows for contactless payments.
              They can be done via the web and at stationary points in your area,
              including grocery stores, fuel stations, beauty salons, and many more.<br></br>

            <p className="litepaper_second_p">NFC, QR and WEB3: <br />
              Shops will enable two ways of purchase for you: a QR code system
              that will redirect you to your basket in DAPP.
              And via official Safereum terminals, that support one-use cards generated in your wallet
              use NFC technology for contactless payments.</p>
