        <h3>TOKEN DISTRIBUTION.</h3>
        <p>All the Andromeda Tokens are pre-mined;
        hence Andromeda Token is not mineable.
        The main distribution of Andromeda
        Token will happen during Launchpad ICO,
        before that, the equivalent of 2% total
        supply will be distributed for pre-sales.
        There is another 0.1% of total supply
        planned for airdrops/events to
        be distributed. <br />
          <br />
        Max supply of Andromeda Token is
        1,000,000,000,000,000  from which
        50% of the supply was burned at the start.
        That means total supply is
        500,000,000,000,000 and part of it
        will be burned manually.
        </p>
